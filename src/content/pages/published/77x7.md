*77x7* was an event by *Latent Works* spanning block 13302102 through 13338142 on the Ethereum blockchain. Over the course of seven days 77 fully in-chain artworks evolved through seven iterations as they were minted from their contract. Each work's iterations and final state was determined on the first mint, but would only exist as a latent in-chain promise until minted. The project gained adequate interest and so all the work editions are now minted and preserved for anyone to enjoy.
