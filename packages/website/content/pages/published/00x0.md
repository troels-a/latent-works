With 00x0 _EXPANDER_ we're migrating, manifesting and expanding the LW project in one collective movement. By using 77x7 works as seeds new compositions emerge; vibrant structures bulding on the basic properties of it's origins. Colors are reused and rearranged in a new architecture where all properties, both aesthetic and practical, are determined by the quantity and sequence of the works seeded.

Seeders actually transfer their works to the contract, prompting the creation of a new composite piece and the issuing of a LTNT passport 1/1 for each transfer.
